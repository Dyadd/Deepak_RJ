    "text": "The Implementation Challenge\nWe clinicians will, or already are, using AI tools at work. It’s crucial that we, as a field, speak the same language as those implementing these tools. This is to ensure patient safety (Epic’s Sepsis cautionary tale) and to use the tools properly. They are quite good, and we should make the most of them.\n\nUnderstanding AI: Models vs Products\nA crucial distinction often missed is that an AI model itself is not a product. Take OpenAI as an example - while they excel at building powerful models, their success with ChatGPT comes from transforming that model into a helpful assistant. As highlighted in this brilliant Stanford talk, considering the specific context and software surrounding the model allows us to be imaginative and practical.\n\n\nThe Clinical Decision Support Dilemma\nConsider clinical decision support in radiology. While companies focus on creating high-performance diagnostic models, the implementation pathway remains unclear. There is practical use in screening and translating reports for patient understanding, but clinical practice implementation remains murky.\nCurrently, using the model, the main product being created is one that generates imaging reports. Here are some options:\n\n\nImplementation Models\n\nHuman & AI Case Collaboration\n\nClinician works on the case at the same time as the AI\nThe AI report is visible for the clinician to use as desired\n\nAI-First Verification\n\nAI generates initial report\nClinician reviews and validates\n\nHuman-First Verification\n\nClinician writes initial report\nAI system performs error check\nDiscrepancies trigger senior clinician review\n\nAI as a Co-Worker\n\nAI handles routine cases & calculates confidence/complexity metrics\nComplex cases routed to senior clinician where appropriate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Models are like GPT-4o\n\n\n\nCurrent models lack intelligent clinician-AI interaction. For instance, a very obvious to improve interaction would be to show clinicians a tree-of-thought reasoning trace for clinical reasoning transparency. As of writing this article, these are not the norm. Assume we’re talking about your run-of-the-mill GPT-4o fine-tuned on radiology data, generating reports.\n\n\nWithout sufficient thought to human-computer interaction, it’s looking pretty bleak.\nOptions 1, 2 and likely 3 cause time-poor and stressed out radiologists. Option 1’s ‘helpful’ reporter product is like a genius who sometimes gets the hardest question right and sometimes the easiest question wrong. In a healthcare setting, there is limited value - more time will be spent on all discordant cases (which may not even result in better clinical performance). Option 2 is option 1 in disguise - you risk over-reliance or ignoring useful outputs. Option 3 is more useful; it sets clear boundaries on the human-AI relationship. By only making the AI visible in discordant cases, it may serve as a good tool to ‘triage’ scans up the chain of experience. However, you run into the same ‘Who is right?’ dilemma.\nFinancially, only option 4 makes sense to radiology practices and hospitals. Ide & Talamas describe this as an autonomous agent replacing routine work, displacing humans to more specialised problem-solving. If this leads to better patient outcomes, we must choose this option. However, we also need to face significant restructuring of training programs and retrain displaced early-career specialists.",

Why can’t we have asked questions like: - How can we automatically identify and show the radiologist the key references (Radiopaedia/StatDx) they would need to look at to solve this case? - Can we automatically show the patient’s last 5 CXRs, process them and identify exactly where changes have evolved? - Considering the speed of system 1 thinking, how can we best display anomaly detection with attached tree-of-thought reasoning traces while enabling a clinician’s systematic read of an image? - During dictation, can we let the radiologist think out in a very unstructured manner, offering real-time reasoning feedback as well as scribing a high quality radiology report? - Can we automate and adapt reporting for specific protocolised research guidelines? - Can we use LLMs to enhance inter-radiologist communication to get rapid second opinions from leading experts?",

    "text": "Why are we here?\nOutside of a resource-poor setting, there is little unmet clinical need for an autonomous radiologist agent. The explosion of AI, the abundance of radiology reports and the monetary value in creating a high-quality autonomous agent all culminates in these foundation models that can perform exceptionally well.\nHowever, given its training with human-labelled reports and diagnoses, I question if we can truly grow in medicine with these types of models. Can we get closer to ‘perfect medicine’ by having models that talk and breathe our biases?\nHere is a direction I think would be more fruitful, we already have high-quality intelligent staff, why can’t we empower them to perform efficiently and improve to be their best? All of those 6 questions I’ve posed that aim to directly augment a radiologist’s work are tractable now. Note that they are useful products, not necessarily new models. Unsupervised data-driven approaches can teach us so much about biomedicine - medicine will look incredibly different in the upcoming decades. We need nimble well-supported staff and better non-autonomous copilots to 10x their clinical impact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Note on Human-Centered Design\n\n\n\nAs we develop these systems, we must prioritize designs that: - Enhance clinical workflows rather than disrupting them - Support rather than replace clinical judgment - Maintain the human elements of healthcare delivery",

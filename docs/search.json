    "text": "The Implementation Challenge\nAs clinicians increasingly interact with AI tools, two critical aspects emerge:\n\nPatient Safety: We must speak the same language as AI implementers to ensure proper safeguards. The concerning implementation of Epic’s Deterioration Index without extensive peer review serves as a cautionary tale [@epic2021deterioration]\nOptimal Utilization: These tools show remarkable promise, but only if we use them correctly [@bmc2023healthcare]\n\n\nUnderstanding AI: Models vs Products\nA crucial distinction often missed in healthcare is that an AI model itself is not a product. Take OpenAI as an example - while they excel at building powerful models, their success with ChatGPT comes from transforming that model into a helpful assistant. As highlighted in Stanford’s research, we should shift our thinking towards compound AI systems [@stanford2024compound].",

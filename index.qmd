# Deepak RJ

I write about medical AI for clinicians, with a focus on actualising AI for psychiatry - the only medical specialty with worsening outcomes.

As a medical student, AI researcher, and long-term insight meditator, I track how technology is reshaping healthcare while exploring deeper questions about consciousness, attention, identity, and what it means to understand minds. I work at the tight-knit [MMTL](https://www.linkedin.com/company/monash-medical-technology-lab/).
